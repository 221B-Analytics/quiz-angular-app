                    <h3><strong>Our founder</strong></h3>
                    <p class="mt-4">
                        Oraculi was founded by Sahasra Chinthireddy in 2022. She is a high school student who has
                        extensive knowledge of tutoring services, but she "discovered a gap in being able to find
                        resources available to help elevate my basic life skills." This inspired her to create Oraculi,
                        an online platform that makes such skills easily accessible. Oraculi is Latin for mentor, and
                        the core principle behind our app is the mentor's knowledge that they bring to our platform, as
                        well as how their expertise impacts people and returns positively towards our community.
